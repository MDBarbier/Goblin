# Goblin
Simple programming language for learning to code




Goal

The goal of this project is to create a programming language with a simple syntax for learning to code compiled programs from scratch.


Compiler

The first version of the compiler will be written in c, and will be able to either compile .goblin files, but can also be used as a command line interpreter.

Later, my plan is to create a self-hosting compiler which will be compiled by the c version and then used to compile all future goblin programs.
